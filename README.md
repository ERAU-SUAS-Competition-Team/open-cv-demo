# open-cv-demo
Demo files to teach the basics of OpenCV to the team.
---
Covers:
- File management
- Image Transformations
- Color Spaces
- Edge Detection Methods
- Contour Detection Methods
- Morphological Effects (Modifiers)
- Blob Detection
- Target Locating!
- Lots of useful resources for learning more!

If you are going to use the Blob Detection Demo file, make sure to download the images from the Google Drive! They are a little too big to comfortably fit on our Github organization with our limited storage. See the discord for the link.
